## :dog: SET-UP

+ visit https://co2-much.herokuapp.com/ , or
+ set up locally:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Go to the repo folder `Week5-BARb`.
3. Run `npm i` to install all the packages used.
4. Run `npm start` to run the server.
5. Visit `localhost:4000` in your browser - you're set up!

## :hammer: BUILT WITH

+ Javascript
+ Node.js
    + request
+ Heroku

## :angry: API

We used KCL's London Air API: https://www.londonair.org.uk/LondonAir/API/.

:heavy_check_mark: 1. Use at least 1 API

:heavy_check_mark: 2. Make your API calls from the back-end using the Request module (or one you build yourself)

:heavy_check_mark: 3. Your server should contain a minimum of 2 routes

4. We expect to see lots of tests! Modularise your code and test all your pure functions. Write tests for as much of your back-end and front-end logic as you can. We don't expect tests on the DOM.

5. Test your server routes by injecting fake HTTP requests using Supertest (including testing for 404's). Note - you are not required to test any server route that makes an API call, as this will make the test impure (a test that depends on an external factor is not reliable)

:heavy_check_mark: 6. Host your project on Heroku, see resources

:heavy_check_mark: 7. Use module.exports and require to break a single large server file into smaller modules.

:heavy_check_mark: 8. Consider a good server file structure based on what we have discussed over the week.

9. Employ continuous integration on your project with Travis or a similar tool. (If you decide to use Travis, we strongly recommend that you host this project in your own repo rather than in your cohort's FAC repository to avoid all builds getting queued together)

10. Use CodeCov or a similar tool to report and track test coverage.

:heavy_check_mark: ish 11. Include Error Handling.

12. Include a user input field on your web app and include server-side validation to protect your server from potentially malicious user input.

13. Display continuous integration and code coverage badges on your project README.

## :mortar_board: Things that we learned
### There's no line of code too small to console.log()

### How the backend passes API responses to the front end (using the request module)

### You can't use .map() to parse a set of nested objects


## :sad: Things that we struggled with

### Naming variables!

### Understanding what is going in/coming out of our handler functions
